# Yale Menus API

> A powerful API for Yale's dining services.

Formerly YaleDine.

## Motivation
Yale formerly maintained a dining API which provided information about dining hall status, menus, allergens, etc. That API, although messy and non-standard, was open to public use, and was used in student projects such as [Yale Menus](https://github.com/ErikBoesen/YaleMenus), [Yale Dining Plus](https://github.com/amalik12/dining_plus), [and](https://github.com/ErikBoesen/yaledining) [others](https://github.com/ErikBoesen/yale).

However, as of the 2020-21 year, that API was mostly deprecated in favor of a new dining system run by JAMIX. This service has no public API and is now the only source for menus and meal information.

In the interest of open data, YaleDine was created to act as a middleman between client and Yale's various services, scraping dining data from all available sources and making it available in standards-compliant, developer-friendly formats.

YaleDine was later rebranded as the Yale Menus API.
